POC with Express.js and Vue.js for searching iTunes albums

1.	Create an Express.js app that accomplishes the following:
	a.	Connects to the iTunes Search API: https://tinyurl.com/itunes-search-api 
	b.	Pulls back a list of albums for a specified artist
	c.	Filters the results so there are no duplicate albums (based on album name)
	d.	Serves the filtered results to the front-end via a route
